# RedditScrape
Description: 
This script is designed to compile the top ~500 posts from abortion-related subreddits early in 2020, ranked by upvotes and date. Titles and text of each post were formatted to be easily imported into NVivo qualitative analysis software. Use your favorite Python IDE to interpret the code, which can be adapted to suit your specific needs.
